# Coding Puzzles
---
This repository serves as a home for all of the coding puzzles I have solved, and eventually in all of the languages that I know and love

## Target Languages:
- [x] C/C++ (debating whether or not C/C++ should be seperate
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Rust/Go (haven't decided yet)

## Future plans:
Add a robust tester (maybe in bash?) that will compile all problems, run them, check the results, and compare the languages against each other
